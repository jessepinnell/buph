# XRSRV - ExeRcise SeRVer
> Workout and physical fitness database and software library

XRSRV is intended to be a fully open-source back-end database and library for physical fitness routines and workout
management software.  However, for now it will serve as a place to share scripts and utilities for generating workouts in HTML format to
be printed and put on a clipboard.  Eventually, the idea is to have both a fully functional web and a local API which will ease writing user
interfaces on any number of devices.  We'll see how far it gets.

While there are many examples of mature projects that provide essentially the same thing, XRSRV is more focused on the
overall logic involved.  Plus, it's a good software exercise, no pun intended.

This project will be written in a platform-independent (assuming someone will port it to Windows, but we'll do our best when doing the Linux
development) manner and will follow strict coding and formatting standards.
